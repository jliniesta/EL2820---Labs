    "In this home-work assignment, you will simulate an \"acrobot\" (see figure below), which is a simple robot consisting of two bars, of masses $m_1$, $m_2$ and lengths $l_1$, $l_2$, respectively, joined by an elbow. The top bar has one of its ends hooked to a fixed support. A motor is connected to the elbow between the two bars, and it can provide an external torque $\\tau$. The figure also shows the coordinate system used to describe the positions of the joints and the centers of mass of the bars (denoted by the circles in the middle of each bar), as well as the angle that each bar makes with respect to the negative $y$-axis."
